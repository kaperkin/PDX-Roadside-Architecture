		<h2>What is Roadside Architecture?</h2>
			<p>Roadside Architecture is a building that becomes the sign for a business it houses. There are three categories: Thematic, Iconic, and whimsical.</p>
		
		<a href = "thematic.html">
		<h3><span class = "firstLetter">T</span>hematic</h3>
		</a>
			<p>Thematic Roadside Architecture borrows styles from another time or culture. Thematic styles may be from a single culture or a blending of many. The goal is to create a unique experience through the architecture that marries commercial interests with travelogues. Do you know a building that fits this category?

		<a href = "iconic.html">	
		<h3> <span class = "firstLetter">I</span>conic</h3>
		</a>
			<p>Iconic Roadside Architecture results when the public recognizes a building that is so unique it becomes the image of the business. Either by intent or accident, the building becomes a logo, instantly connecting product to architecture. Do you know a building that fits this category?

		<a href = "whimsical.html">
		<h3><span class = "firstLetter">W</span>himsical</h3>
		</a>
			<p>Whimsical Roadside Architecture uses a common object to form a building or part of a building. The object may represent the business, but not always. This is the most delightful of Roadside works. To be Whimsical, the object does not need to form the entire building, but can simply be incorporated into the design.
